# pizza_sales_analysis
This project provided a significant opportunity to refine my SQL skills and to observe the direct impact of data analytics on business decision-making. The potential of SQL to generate actionable insights is inspiring, and I am eager to delve deeper into this field.

The project process involved the following steps:
1. Collected data from multiple CSV files and consolidated it into a SQL server after unzipping the folder.
2. Cleaned the data to remove any junk or missing fields, ensuring high-quality data for analysis.
3. Structured the data to reveal relationships between various factors, such as the highest-priced pizza.
4. Utilized SQL commands to uncover key insights including total sales, most common pizza size, highest-priced pizza, category-wise pizza distribution, cumulative revenue analysis, orders distribution by hour, average orders, and more.
5. Integrated data from different tables in the Model View to visualize substantial pizza sales.
6. Grouped and sorted the data to identify trends and strategize for increased profitability.
7. Enhanced the presentation with images and a well-designed background to make the insights visually appealing.
